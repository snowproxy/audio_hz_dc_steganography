# audio_hz_dc_steganography
a python script to perform audio steganography tasks assigning characters to hz / decibels to encode text

Audio_hz.py is the most optimized for storing data, with more audio frames closer together it allows more data to be compacted into shorter audio files, audio_dc.py is less optimized but uses decibels instead of hz. enjoy!
